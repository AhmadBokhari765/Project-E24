Based on the score we received from the Smart Ethics AI Toolkit score of 6.4/10. Our AI system shows promise in the human-first design, transparency, and sustainability. However, there are critical issues in data privacy, risk mitigation, and real-world readiness. 
We have prepared an action plan to ensure ethical compliance, governance, and responsible AI deployment.
Rights & Privacy: 
Data Privacy Measures
•	Employ GDPR/CCPA based  data anonymization.
•	Conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA).
Impact Management
•	Implement protocols for user consent and data deletion requests.
Purpose Realisation
	Clear Objectives
o	Before implementing AI in any field, it is essential to classify specific , achievable, related and time-bound goals. Like what AI trying to do? What will be the expected outcome? 
Scope and Limitations
o	Understand the boundaries of what Ai can and cannot perform, the environment where it can be applied.
Risk Evaluation
	Security and Harm Mitigation 
o	Employ adversarial testing (reproduce attacks to target weaknesses).
o	Gather a red-teaming protocol to perform ethical hacking.
Risk Ownership
o	Clearly specify accountability of decisions through consent forms or documentations.
Responsible Redesign 
	Real-World Testing
o	Test AI in a sandbox environment with real users
o	Observe for unpredictable results
Disruption Metrics 
o	Track job displacement and reskilling rates.
o	Use sentimental analysis to evaluate impacts on society.
Moreover, there are sectors where AI is doing acceptable job. However, there is room for the improve. We have also created suggestive plans to improve on those factors.
Stakeholders Onboarding
	Transparency Portal
o	Create an interactive changelog showcasing how feedback is applied
Model Performance
Bias Bounty Program
o	Reward players for reporting biased/unfair AI behaviours.
Performance Dashboards
o	Observe real-time metrics using Grafana or Tableau.
Global Disruption
	Cultural Sensitivity Panels
o	Hire consults from specific regions to review contents from their regions. 
Localized Playtests
o	Partner with gaming cafes around the world to test the AI behaviour in their countries.
