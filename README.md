# Project-E24
A group project for 3 second year AI students, members include Samik, Nokhaiz and Syed. This project involves creation of a board game called Origins and automating it using an RL Agent.

# Problem Statement
We have been assigned the game that we are required to create from the scratch utilizing the rules provided and ensure that game is capable of automation meaning that it can play against the human being without the need for two people.

# Functional and Non-Functional Requirements
Functional Requirements

1. Installation of Unity and Microsoft Visual Studio for setting up game environment.

2. Game mechanics: The game should allows players to control pieces on a board to ensure they move according to the rules. 

3. Playability: The game should be playable between human to human, and human to AI.

4. User Interface (UI); The game should have an interactive UI to allow seamless gameplay between human player and RL bot.

5. Game State: The game should be able to track the game state (i.e., player turn, piece positions, win-loss-draw conditions).

6. Move validation: The system should validate allowed moves based on the rules of the OrOgins game.

7. Automated Gameplay: The RL agent should be able to play against a human, with the capability to make moves and counter human moves efficiently 

8. Save and Resume: The game should allow user to save and resume the game.

9. Game Restart: Player should be able to restart the game at any point while playing game.

10. Move suggestions: The game should provide hint to the user for available move for each piece to eliminate incorrect moves.

Non-Functional Requirements

Cross-platform Compatibility: The game should be playable on multiple platforms, like Windows and potentially mobile devices.

1. User Experience (UX): The game should deliver an interactive experience for the player with balanced complexity, receptive AI and visually attractive graphics.

2. Resilience: The game should be able to recover from unexpected events, like crashes or power failures, retaining the game data, managing the game in consistent state.

3. Difficulty Level: The game should have different levels of difficulty for RL bot like Easy, Medium, and Hard.

4. Game Analytics: The game should log player Win/Loss ratio, playtime, and AI performance, for player tracking and analysis.
